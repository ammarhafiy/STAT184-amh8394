Introduction: This project analyzes the amount of creme filling in Oreo cookies. The data was collected several years ago by Dr. Hatfield's students, who mistakenly weighed the cookies with a scale set to carats instead of grams. The dataset contains two columns: 'mass' (in carats) and 'type' (cookie type). The objective is to convert the weights to grams and create a cleaned dataset with both units of measurement for analysis.

Implementation: 
1. Read the data: The data is fetched from the provided URL.
2. Extract and Clean: The data is extracted as a table, cleaned, and converted.
3. Transformation: We convert the mass from carats to grams using the formula: mass_in_grams = mass * 0.2
4. Select Columns: Keep the relevant columns: 'type', 'mass_in_carats', and 'mass_in_grams'.

Result/Conclusion: The transformation process resulted in a clean dataset with accurate weights in both carats and grams. This ensures accurate analysis of the Oreo creme filling.
